# Blockchain in Node.js

This repository contains the implementation of a simple blockchain in Node.js, for the purpose of studying and learning about the fundamental concepts of blockchain, such as blocks, transactions, and cryptographic security. It also includes an API developed with **Express** to interact with the blockchain.

## Project Objective

This project was developed to explore how a blockchain works internally, applying Node.js programming concepts and using libraries for essential cryptographic functions. The project includes the creation of blocks and transactions, data validation using RSA encryption, and the exposure of endpoints to interact with the blockchain via an API.

## Requirements

This project has been tested with the following dependencies:

- **Node.js**: version 20.16.0 or higher
- **crypto-js**: version 4.2.0 or higher (used for hash and cryptographic functions)
- **node-rsa**: version 1.1.1 or higher (used for key generation and verification)
- **express**: version 4.18.2 or higher (used for the API)
